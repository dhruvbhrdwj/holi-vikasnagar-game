# Texture Assets

Place your photo textures in this folder. The game will load them automatically.

## Required Textures

### House & Verandah
- `house-wall.jpg` - Front wall of your house
- `house-side.jpg` - Side walls (optional, will use house-wall if missing)
- `roof.jpg` - Roof texture
- `verandah-floor.jpg` - Verandah platform floor

### Environment
- `road.jpg` - Road surface texture
- `grass.jpg` - Ground/grass texture
- `sky.jpg` - Sky texture (optional)

### Stores (across the road)
- `store-1.jpg` - First shop front
- `store-2.jpg` - Second shop front
- `store-3.jpg` - Third shop front
- (Add more as store-4.jpg, store-5.jpg, etc.)

## Photo Tips

1. **Size**: 1024x1024 or 2048x2048 pixels work best (power of 2)
2. **Format**: JPG for photos (smaller files), PNG if you need transparency
3. **Stores**: Take front-facing photos of the shops across from your house
4. **House**: Take a photo of your house's front wall straight-on
5. **Road**: A close-up of the road surface works well

## Placeholder Colors

If a texture file is missing, the game will use colored placeholders:
- House: Sandy tan color
- Roof: Brown
- Road: Dark gray
- Grass: Green
- Stores: Random colors
